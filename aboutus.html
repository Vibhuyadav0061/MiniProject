    <ul>
        <li><div style="width:650px ;">Do not run on Treadmill with your Airpods on. I was sold on all the marketing too, before one day the left piece had a free fall while I was running on the treadmill, bounced on the walking belt, and swooped to the side before disappearing from the sight.</div></li>

            Avoid going to gyms early in the morning or evenings. That’s when they’re the most crowded. I go to gym at around 3:30 in the afternoon and never have to wait to get my turn on an equipment. This is of course if your work permits you to be flexible with time.
